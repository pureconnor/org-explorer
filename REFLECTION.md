# Project Summary
First of all I would like to thank you for the opportunity to work on this challenge.
I enjoyed this challenge because of the open-ended nature of the requirements.

## Tech Choices
- NextJS
  - I chose NextJS as it's a relatively newer framework that provides an easy to work with API paired with build tools and systems designed around server side rendering, static rendering, and peformance optimization.
  - There were some drawbacks to choosing this framework as my experience with it is relatively recent. However, I enjoyed working with this as it encouraged me to think performance-first throughout the project
- Tailwindcss
  - This library has been on my radar for some time and I have been eager to use it. After getting started with the initial setup I began thinking more about bundle size, loading components dynamically, and utilizing code splitting a bit more. This caused me to pivot from using styled-components originally which has a larger bundle size.
  - Drawbacks for choosing this for styling library is that, again, my experience with this specific library is new as of this project, so learning the syntax was a time-cost.
- React
  - Aside from being a requirement, I would have chosen React for this as it is currently my favorite flavor.
- @react-react-infinite-scroll-component
  - I needed a system to dynamically continue rendering more organizations and I discovered this package in, admittedly, a pinch. I'm not sure how well this is optimized, but I was aiming to utilize something with virtualization to reduce the hit of performance with rendering many list components.
  - This could have been optimized more from me in terms of loading states and perhaps requiring some user input for a new request for data to get a user more involved. UI/UX Case to be made here perhaps :)
- TypeScript
  - Like React, this has become one of my favorite new industry trends. TypeScript offers rich developer and IDE support and reduces the chance of runtime errors drastically. I love using TS in my projects for these reasons and so choosing it here was a no-brainer. I'll take any opportunity to continue improving on my TS skills.

## Take Away
I would say I'm satisfied, but just, with this work. My experience with relatively, and completely, new technologies was drastically improved upon during this excersise and for that alone I'm happy to have built what is here.

I think due to the time constraint and external obligations I wasn't able to get as much done as I had hoped. I would liked to have added better styling, perhaps better routing, a testing framework ( jest & react-testing-library were in mind ), and even GitHub actions or a mini-CI/CD pipeline. I would also really have enjoyed to have enough time to create a sprint board with a prioritization list. I think that would have been helpful for me to make sure I hit requirements and developed in a more efficient manner.

Overall I'm glad I had the experience to work on this challenge and I appreciate any feedback!
